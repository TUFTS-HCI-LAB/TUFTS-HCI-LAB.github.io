However, in its first decade of research this technology has not yet realized its potential. A primary barrier to success has been that observed fNIRS signals vary significantly across human users. Building models that generalize well to never-before-seen users has been difficult; a large amount of subject-specific data has been needed to train effective models. To help overcome this barrier, we introduce the largest open-access dataset of its kind, containing multivariate fNIRS recordings from over 60 participants, each with labeled segments indicating four possible mental workload intensity levels. Labels were collected via a controlled setting in which subjects performed standard n-back tasks to induce desired working memory levels. We further define an evaluation protocol which allows future users to report comparable numbers and fairly assess generalization potential while avoiding any overlap or leakage between train and test data. Using this dataset and standardized protocol, we show how deep learning models pre-trained using abundant fNIRS data from other participants can be effectively fine-tuned for new subjects, reaching accuracies similar to data-hungry subject-specific models while using a fraction of the data. We further show how performance improves as the size of the available dataset grows, while also analyzing error rates across key subpopulations to explore equity concerns. We share our open-access dataset and open-source code as a step toward advancing brain computer interfaces that work for many users.")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"code"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#code"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Code")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/lwang89/code_for_UIST.git",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Here is the link to our code Github repo"),t("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"dataset"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#dataset"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Dataset")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Public dataset release pending imminent approval from IRB.\n")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"data-description"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#data-description"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Data Description")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"data-structure"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#data-structure"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Data Structure")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"data-format"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#data-format"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Data Format")]),e._v(" "),t("h4",{attrs:{id:"pre-experiment"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#pre-experiment"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Pre-experiment")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("It includes the non sensitive personal data we collect before the experiment.")]),e._v(" "),t("h4",{attrs:{id:"experiment-data"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#experiment-data"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Experiment Data")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("All fNIRS data store here, along with the n-back tasks accuracy and experiment log.")]),e._v(" "),t("ol",[t("li",[e._v("raw data;")]),e._v(" "),t("li",[e._v("band-pass-filtered;\n2.a. bpf_raw_data;\n2.b. bpf_filtered_slide_window_data;")])]),e._v(" "),t("h4",{attrs:{id:"supplementary-data"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#supplementary-data"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Supplementary Data")]),e._v(" "),t("h5",{attrs:{id:"demographic-and-contextual-information"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#demographic-and-contextual-information"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Demographic and contextual information")]),e._v(" "),t("h5",{attrs:{id:"subjective-workload"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#subjective-workload"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" subjective workload")]),e._v(" "),t("h5",{attrs:{id:"post-experiment-interview"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#post-experiment-interview"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" post-experiment interview")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"paper-link-and-please-cite"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#paper-link-and-please-cite"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Paper link and Please Cite")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://openreview.net/forum?id=QzNHE7QHhut",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Paper link"),t("OutboundLink")],1)])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);a.default=s.exports}}]);
